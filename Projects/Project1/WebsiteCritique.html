<h1>Web Site Critiques</h1>

<h2>Pitchfork — https://pitchfork.com</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>My First Impressions:</strong><br>
		I really liked how the font and colors feel minimalistic but inviting, I actually felt upon
		first viewing of the site that it could be some sort of news article but took a second to
		realize it's focused on music. They give us some headlines and "The Latest" right off the bat
		so from a user retention standpoint I think they did a pretty good job there.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>How It's Organized:</strong><br>
		It's organized in a very grid-y boxy sort of way with the main articles right at the top,
		followed by some spots for "Reviews", "More Reviews", "More From Pitchfork", "Features" and 
		lastly "Sunday Reviews" it has spots to navigate the site at the top as well.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Does The Structure Make Sense:</strong><br>
		The structure itself is really clear and easy to navigate, headings indicate where different
		sections will start, one part I don't like is the amount of white space at the top. I feel
		like they should have just moved their content up a little, maybe it's an intentional choice
		not entirely sure.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Do The Graphics Help:</strong><br>
        I think it enhances the site and makes it look quite professional, I think some tasteful use
		of color to emphasize important details could be useful for this website.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Loading Time:</strong><br>
        The home page was loaded in like half a second. With all the images on pitchforks site I think its reasonable.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Text Readability:</strong><br>
        The text is very readable given the nature of the website with black text, white background which
		gives a good contrast.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Navigation:</strong><br>
        It has multiple different navigation links at the top as well as a hamburger menu for additional
		details.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Consistent Theme:</strong><br>
        The site has a consistent look and feel across its pages with the same familiar black and white.
        Pretty much all the elements are the same across pages, which I can appreciate.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Responsive Design:</strong><br>
        Their site adjusts to pretty much every size seamlessly, I even tried using inspect element to grab
		different phones or weird sizes. They all worked great.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Unusual or Well-Done Features:</strong><br>
		With the empty space at the top aside, I do think they did a very great job spacing out
		all of the content so that it's super readable and digestable for the user. I do also
		really like the font they used, it works really well with the minimalistic white and black style.
